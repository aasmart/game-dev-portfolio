<strong>Contributions</strong>
<ul>
  <li>Developed a robust camera system to track the player through horizontally and vertically scrolling rooms</li>

  <li></li>
</ul>

<strong>Technology Used</strong>
<ul>
  <li>Unity</li>
  <li>C#</li>
</ul>

<strong>Custom Feature</strong>
<p>I co-developoed a new ground pound system for Metroid in addition to a suite of custom levels to explore this feature.
This vision for this feature was to enhance combat and mobility</p>
<ul>
  <li>Peform an attack that launches the player downward at high speeds</li>
  <li>Bounce off grounded enemies (in addition to Rippers) for extra height and interesting movement</li>
  <li>Make strategic decisions between normal attacks and ground pounding</li>
</ul>
