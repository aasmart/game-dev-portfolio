<h3><a href="https://rafesymonds.itch.io/metroid-nes-remake-p1-gold-eecs-494">Metroid (Unity Remaster)</a></h3>
<strong>Contributions</strong>
<ul>
  <li>Developed a robust camera system to track the player through horizontally and vertically scrolling rooms</li>
  <li>Implemented numerous enemies with careful attention to their behavior to make them accurate to the original game</li>
  <li>Designed a simple drop system component to easily add multiple drop types along with condtions for each of those drops</li>
</ul>

<strong>Custom Feature</strong>
<p>I co-developoed a new ground pound system for Metroid in addition to a suite of custom levels to explore this feature.
This vision for this feature was to enhance combat and mobility</p>
<ul>
  <li>Peform an attack that launches the player downward at high speeds</li>
  <li>Bounce off grounded enemies (in addition to Rippers) for extra height and interesting movement</li>
  <li>Make strategic decisions between normal attacks and ground pounding</li>
</ul>

<strong>Technology Used</strong>
<ul>
  <li>Unity</li>
  <li>C#</li>
</ul>

<strong>Contributions</strong>
<ul>
  <li>Developed a system to reflect the character through multiple mirrors, and have mirrors also reflect mirrors</li>
  <li>Carefully designed levels to teach players new features and nuances of the reflection mechanic</li>
  <li>Implemented special effects such as shaders and particles to better visualize game state</li>

  <li>Co-developed an early iteration of the game's core magnet physics system and a merging system that cleverley used composition and inheritance for the possibility of future expansion</li>
  <li>Designed several shaders to enhance the look and player experience of the game</li>
  <li>Hand-crafted 10+ level unique and interesting to carefully teach players new mechanics, test them on learned mechanics, and provide an enjoyable experience</li>
